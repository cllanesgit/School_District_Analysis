## School_District_Analysis

#Overview

This analysis gives an overview of the data provided by every school of student average scores for both math and reading courses. The overall average scores for both were very high averaging above 90% overall passing score for some of the top schools. Some of these top schools were Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School. All of this schools were charter schools that had a lower-end budget and yet, achieved scores of 80+, averaging at 93+% passing in math and reading . According to the charts and calculated data, it seems that neither the size or the budget made a big contribution towards the success of these students.

For bottom schools, passing percentages were much worse, however, the average scores were still passing. This may be caused to a wide array of very low, to very high scores and very little consistency. 

#Summary

Charter schools definitely seemed to be the better bets for the highest scores out of all of them, easily beating district schools. However, after these top 5 high schools, some district schools were sure to follow score-wise. All bottom schools seemed to be district schools. After the altering of the data, there were certainly some changes, but it still seemed linear.
